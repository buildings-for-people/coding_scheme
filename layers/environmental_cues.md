# Environmental cues 

Environmental cues are all those physical elements of the 
environment that, even if hard or impossible to quantify, are 
used by people both consciously and unconsciously. Together with 
[Objective Climatic Factors](layer=objective_climatic_factors),
Environmental cues contribute to the mixture of inputs used by the brain to 
generate the [feeling of comfort](layer=comfort).

A conscious use of environmental cues happens, for instance,
when purchasing a dwelling. People might check whether the 
windows in a certain room are of a decent size and not obstructed
in order to infer whether there will be good daylight.

An unconscious use of environmental cues happens, for instance, 
when people's thermal sensation votes are affected by the 
appearance of the space. This effect, we believe, is explained
by people's trained intuition. For instance, it would 
seem that respondents tend to relate warm air with polluted 
air. This link might be related to the common experience of 
entering poorly ventilated crowded rooms (e.g. arriving late to 
class or to a meeting), in which the air is commonly warm and polluted. 
In contrast, it is rare to get into a space where the air is cold 
and polluted.
