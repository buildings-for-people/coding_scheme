# Internal Elements

Comfort is a subjective experience, and therefore, the starting
point for the generation of comfort is the individual.

The process in which the [feeling of comfort](layer=comfort) is
generated starts with a person's internal elements. Together with [Objective Climatic Factors](layer=objective_climatic_factors) and [Environmental Cues](layer=environmental_cues),
Internal Elements conform what is known as the "Situation". Namely, 
the group of relevant elements, both physical and psychological, that
will determine the [feeling of comfort](layer=comfort). 

Internal elements will shape the way in which individuals will appraise the 
"Situation", developing [perceptions](layer=perceptions),
[trade-offs](layer=trade-offs) and [expectations](layer=expectations).

Different domains of comfort (e.g. Daylight, Acoustic, etc.) will depend
on different characteristics of the person. Assessing the internal elements 
of the target population, whether it is a demographic group or an individual
who wants a house for him/herself, will help design a more comfortable
home.
