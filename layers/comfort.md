# Comfort

Comfort is the state of the mind felt by individuals who
are not perceiving any nuisances *right-here-right-now* ([perceptions](layer=perceptions)),
do not expect to perceive any nuisances in the future ([expected outcomes](layer=expected_outcomes)), 
and did not make any significant sacrifices ([trade-offs](layer=trade-offs)) in order to
be in their current state.

Comfort is a goal in itself, and not a means to anything. 
People seek comfort simply because they feel like it is 
something good.
