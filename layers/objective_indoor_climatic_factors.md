# Objective indoor climatic factors 

Objective indoor climatic factors are those physical aspects
of the environment that Building Scientists have traditionally
measured. Namely, temperature, solar radiation, illuminance,
relative humidity and so on. These factors are a consequence 
of the design of homes, the surroundings, their placement (e.g.
orientation) and the climate.

These factors are sensed by human's physiological systems and,
together with [Environmental Cues](layer=environmental_cues),
contribute to the mixture of inputs used by the brain to 
generate the [feeling of comfort](layer=comfort).
