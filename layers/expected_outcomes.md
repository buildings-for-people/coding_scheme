# Expected outcomes

While [perceptions](layer=perceptions) dwell in the present and
[trade-offs](layer=trade-off) dwell in the past,
expectations reflect the fact that people make decisions based on 
the future as well. In this regard, they are constantly aware of 
what might happen, estimating the level of comfort that they may feel
in the future.

This is translated not only into a desire for comfort 
[all the time in all the locations](code=comfort_everywhere_and_all_the_time) of the dwelling that they might visit, but also into a desire for 
[systems that do not fail](code=systems_that_do_not_fail)
, for [systems that are easy to use](code=systems_that_are_easy_to_use), 
and for 
[dwellings that do not depend too much on external systems to be comfortable](code=passive_design).
