# Expected outcomes

While [perceptions](layer=perceptions) dwell in the present and
[trade-offs](layer=trade-offs) dwell in the past,
expected outcomes reflect the fact that people make decisions based on 
the future as well. In this regard, they are constantly aware of 
what might happen, estimating the level of comfort that they may feel
in the future.

This is translated into a desire for comfort 
all the time in all the locations of the dwelling that they might visit. This should hopefully mean
[dwellings that do not depend too much on external systems to be comfortable](code=passive_design), 
or dwellings that are equipped with [effective and simple systems](code=effective_and_simple_systems) that allow fixing potentially uncomfortable situations and 
[systems that do not fail](code=systems_that_do_not_fail). If none of these 
three conditions are available, people might hope
that the nuisances are [temporary](code=temporary).
