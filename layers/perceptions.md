# Perceptions

Perceptions are the way in which people interpret the stimuli
generated by the environment through physiological phenomena. 

Common examples of perceptions are the so-called Thermal Sensation, 
and Glare. However, the paradigm of comfort introduced here has
identified several other perceptions worth studying. For instance, 
some respondents mentioned that daylight reduced the 
[feeling of confinement](code=feeling_of_confinement). 

Further research is required to understand what specific 
variables affect this feeling, and the same happens with 
other perceptions. It is possible, in fact, that some of the 
perceptions identified are actually just one that was expressed
in different ways, or different magnitudes within the same dimension. 
For instance, the [feeling of confinement](code=feeling_of_confinement)
might just be another way of calling the 
[sense of connection with the exterior](code=sense_of_connection_with_the_exterior).
