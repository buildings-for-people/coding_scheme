# Trade-offs 

Just like [expected outcomes](layer=expected_outcomes) reflect the fact 
that people make decisions based on the future, trade-offs 
reflect the fact decisions of today can affect people's future 
feeling of comfort. Namely, they reflect the fact that people place 
comfort and [perceptions](layer=perceptions) within the broader 
context of their lives because they understand
that improving one area of comfort might affect other areas 
relevant for their wellbeing.

In other words, trade-offs represent the cost of achieving comfort in one 
domain in exchange for nuisances in another. Comfortable dwellings
should reduce the need for these kinds of decisions.

Note that some trade-offs connect different domains of what has historically been
associated with comfort by the building sciences(e.g. thermal comfort vs acoustics).
However, other trade-offs connect these traditional domains with other elements
that affect people's wellbeing but that are not necessarily related to the physical
performance of the dwelling (e.g. air quality vs safety).
