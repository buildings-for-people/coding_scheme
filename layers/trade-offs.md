# Trade-offs 

Just like [expectations](layer=expectations) reflect the fact 
that people make decisions based on the future, trade-offs 
reflect the fact that people's current 
[perceptions](layer=perceptions) are the result of decisions
that will affect other areas of their lives. Specifically, 
trade-offs represent the cost of achieving comfort in one 
domain in exchange for nuisances in another. Comfortable dwellings
should reduce the need for these kinds of decisions.
