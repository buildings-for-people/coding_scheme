# proximity to neighbours

Neighbours can be the source of certain nuisances that are particularly hard to control. 
Specifically, noise, privacy, and odours seem to be common concerns. This might be related to their [pets](code=pets)
or to the neighbours themselves.

So, if neighbours are too close, people will infer that they 
will be exposed to some uncomfortable situations in the future.
