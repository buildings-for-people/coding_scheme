# sense of community

Even if [neighbours might be the source of some nuisances](code=proximity_to_neighbours), people 
seem keen to be part of a community. This perception seems to be particularly (although not
exclusively) produced by the sound that other people make when performing recreational
activities, such as playing, laughing, and practising sports.
