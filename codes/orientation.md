### orientation

The sun does not strike equally in all directions. In the northern
hemisphere, the sun will generally strike from the South; while in 
the southern hemisphere, from the North. These differences imply that
some orientations will receive more sunlight and, therefore, be hotter, 
brighter and more or less pleasant.
