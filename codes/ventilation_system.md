# ventilation system

[Windows](code=availability_of_windows_and_skylights) are good for air quality. But they are not always available or sometimes they are not effective enough. A mechanical ventilation system—e.g. an exhaust fan—can help.

It is worth noticing that some people do not trust these system too much and favour opening 
windows.
