### loudness

[Loudness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness) 
is a measure of how strong a sound is, and depends mostly
on pressure level (i.e. decibels) and frequency. Within the 
framework we introduce, it is important to acknowledges that 
equal loudness may be more or less unpleasant at different times of the day or at different situations.

People distinguish clearly between different sources
of noise.

* Noise from neighbours

* Noise from common spaces (e.g. pools, parks, lobbies)

* City noise (e.g. traffic, horns, etc.)

* Toilet and pipes noise 

* Noises that come from the house itself (e.g. squeaky doors, cracking floors)

* Noise produced by those who live in the house (e.g. kitchen appliances, children, pets)

These different sources will trigger different cognitive 
responses. For instance, noises from neighbours, common spaces,
and those from the city cannot be controlled and therefore
are unpleasant. On the contrary, noise produced by those who 
live in the house is relatively easier to control and therefore 
less unpleasant. This is highly related to the 
[expected outcomes](layer=expected_outcomes). 

Toilet and pipes noises, on their part, are likely to contribute 
to a perception of reduced [privacy](code=privacy). Finally, noises that come from the house itself are interpreted as an 
indicator of wear and tear, and therefore are unpleasant.
