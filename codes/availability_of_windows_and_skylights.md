# availability of windows and skylights

Windows and skylights are probably the most common and intuitive 
way of letting daylight in. However, not all windows and all
skylights will be equally effective. On the contrary, 
if a room has windows or skylights that are obstructed, or too
small, or there are very few of them, people might not get
the impression of it being properly illuminated. 

As to what do people mean by "decent size" and "lots of windows",
we don't know. It is possible that this will depend on the 
[views](code=views), the [surroundings](code=characteristics_of_the_surroundings),
and perhaps some other factors.
