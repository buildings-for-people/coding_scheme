# dust and smoke

While not always included in the list of relevant factors related to air quality, 
dust can be quite annoying for people. Different [sites](code=site_characteristics) and [neighbourhoods] (code=neighbourhood_characteristics) will be
more or less exposed to dust.

Smoke, of course, has a similar effect. However, it can be less dependant on the site and the neighbourhood and more on neighbours.
