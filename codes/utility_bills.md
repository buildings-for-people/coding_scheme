Utility bills that are too expensive can prevent people from heating and
cooling, thus negatively affecting their living experience. Some people will 
spend whatever amount of money is required to be comfortable, but others will 
simply sacrifice their level of comfort
and avoid spending more than what they have budgeted to this 
field.
