### utility bills

While people do not want comfortable homes in order to save 
money in utility bills, bills that are too high can definitely 
affect the experience of people in their homes in a negative way. 
Some people will spend whatever amount of money is required to be 
comfortable, but others will simply sacrifice their level of comfort
and avoid spending more than what they have budgeted to this 
field. This is related to people's [budget](code=budget).
