# air temperature

The temperature of the air within a space is an important
determinant of thermal comfort. This has been evidenced 
by the thermal comfort literature numerous times. However, the temperature of the air also seems to influence people's perception of air quality; specifically, low temperatures tend to be associated with a cleaner air and high ones with less clean air.

It is possible that when people talk about "air temperature"
they are actually talking about Operative Temperature or Mean
Radiant Temperature without knowing it.
