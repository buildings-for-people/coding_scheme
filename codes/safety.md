# Safety

People often want to open the windows for ventilating or cooling their homes. However, 
leaving the windows open is not always a good idea due to safety concerns (e.g., people can
come in through the windows or people can fall out of them).

Similarly, while it is common ti like quiet homes, a dwelling that is excessively quiet can
make people feel disconnected from the other members of their household and, in consequence,
make them feel unsafe.
