### bed temperature

Sleeping is one of the things people do at home. They want to
sleep in a bed with an appropriate temperature. If it is cold, 
it seems to be something they do remember.

The temperature of the bed is, obviously, related to the temperature 
of the bedroom. However, when talking about warmness, people 
specifically mentioned the bed; whereas, when talking about coolness,
they talked about the temperature of the whole room. This might be
explained by the fact that, when it is too hot, people do not get 
*in* the bed, necessarily.
