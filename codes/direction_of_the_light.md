# direction of the light

While it is not entirely clear why this happens, the angle of the natural
light entering the space might matter. Specifically, respondents 
from Santiago (Chile) argued that the more vertical the 
angle of natural light, the better. Two reasons for this were given. 
The first one is that vertical sun is easier to control 
(i.e. it does not strike over the whole room, just the perimeter),
which is convenient for hot locations with strong solar radiation. The
second reason was related to the fact that light coming from
above emulates an exterior light setting 
better than lateral light.
