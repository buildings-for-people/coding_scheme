### loss of views

Views are not always in the direction that maximizes
daylight. Thus, people sometimes need to choose one or the 
other, unless the dwelling is somehow designed for getting
both.

This code should be applicable also for other domains (e.g.
warmness, coolness, and noise); but it has been mentioned
only for daylight.
