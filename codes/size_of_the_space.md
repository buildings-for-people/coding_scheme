# size of the space

The size of the space affects our perception of it and also its 
thermodynamic and optical behaviour. Bigger spaces tend to be 
harder to warm up and cool down, and smaller spaces are associated with a Feeling
of Confinement (which is related to Coolness). This characteristic
is one of the first elements that people notice, sometimes influencing their assessment of comfort.
