# size of the space

The size of the space affects our perception of it and also its 
thermodynamic and optical behavour. Bigger spaces tend to be 
harder to warm up and cool down, for instance. This characteristic
is one of the first elements that people notice, sometimes associating
it to their assessment of comfort.
