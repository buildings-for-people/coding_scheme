### times of occupancy

The experience of people in a certain dwelling might be 
dramatically different depending on their routines and 
schedules. A retired person, for instance, might want 
to have daylight all day. Whereas a busy person who gets
home late and only sleeps there might favour mornings or 
evenings.
