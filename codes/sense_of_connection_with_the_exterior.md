# sense of connection with the exterior

Having daylight allows people to connect with the exterior.
It helps them feel how the time passes and to distinguish between daytime
and night time. 

It is possible that this perception is related to the 
reduced [feeling of confinement](code=feeling_of_confinement)—also influenced by Daylight—,
but confirming this requires further research.
