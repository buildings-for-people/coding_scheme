### sense of connection with the exterior

Having daylight allows people to connect with the exterior.
It helps them feel how the time passes and whether it is daytime
or nighttime. 

It is possible that this perception is related to the 
reduced [feeling of confinement](code=feeling_of_confinement),
but stating this would require further research.
