### systems that do not fail

Hopefully, homes should be robust enough to 
consistently offer comfortable spaces for people. This implies, 
for instance, that heaters should fail as little a possible; and 
if they fail, this event should not prevent the whole house 
from being livable. Likewise, windows should consistently
keep the cold and rain outside.
