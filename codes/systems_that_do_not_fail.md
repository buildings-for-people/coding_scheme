# systems that do not fail

Hopefully, homes should be robust enough to 
consistently offer comfortable spaces for people. This implies, 
for instance, that heaters should fail as little as possible; and 
if they fail, this event should not prevent the whole house 
from being liveable. In a similar manner, windows, doors, roofs, 
and other architectural elements of the dwelling should perform
appropriately in a consistent manner.
