# neighbourhood characteristics

The infrastructure and the nature of the constructions in different
neighbourhoods affect the way these are perceived by people. Some 
neighbourhoods, for example, have a great amount of restaurants, others
are close to landfields, others only have offices and thus are nearly
empty at night. 

In a similar manner, institutional differences can also affect the way in which 
neighbourhoods perform. For instance, some neighrbourhoods allow people to use
log burners and/or pubs to stay open till late while others do not. This affects
the way the neighbourhood is perceived by the people who live in it.


This code, together with [neighbourhood demographics](code=neighbourhood_demographics)
describe the location at a neighbourhood scale. Specifically, while [demographics](code=neighbourhood_demographics)
describes the human factors (e.g. people are quiet, old, young, etc.),  this code describes the more physical factors.
