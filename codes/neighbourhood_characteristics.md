# neighbourhood characteristics

The infrastructure and the nature of the constructions in different
neighbourhoods affect the way these are perceived by people. Some 
neighbourhoods, for example, have a great number of restaurants, others
are close to land fields, others only have offices and thus are nearly
empty at night. 

Similarly, institutional differences can also affect the way in which 
neighbourhoods perform. For instance, some neighbourhoods allow people to use
log burners and/or pubs to stay open till late while others do not. This affects
the quality of life of the people who live in it.


This code, together with [neighbourhood demographics](code=neighbourhood_demographics),
describe the location at a neighbourhood scale. Specifically, while [Demographics](code=neighbourhood_demographics)
describes the human factors (e.g., people are quiet, old, young, etc.),  this code describes the more physical factors. 
Also, the [Site characteristics](code=site_characteristics) describe the location at a smaller scale.
