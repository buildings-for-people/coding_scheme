A space will be perceived as "sufficiently illuminated" when it has just 
enough natural light to somehow warm it up and allow operating without
the need for electric lighting. However, this quantity does not
seem to be nearly enough. People mentioned the need for 
*quality* of light instead of *quantity* of it and also that they
want much more light than what is required to read a book.

People expressed how they connect the availability of daylight with the 
perception of a space being warm.
