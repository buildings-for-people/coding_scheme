A space will be perceived as "sufficiently illuminated" when it has just 
enough natural light for the sun to warm it up and operating without
the need for electric lighting. However, this quantity does not
seem to be nearly enough. People mentioned the need for 
*quality* of light instead of *quantity* of it and also that they
want much more light than what is required to read a book.

Having enough daylight also seems to be a requisite for a dwelling to be described as Cool, and can make spaces feel cleaner thus favouring their Air Quality.
