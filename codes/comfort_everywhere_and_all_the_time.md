# comfort everywhere and all the time

People want to be comfortable all the time, not just now, but also in the 
future, even if they move. However, are sensible and only expect comfort when 
it reasonable to ask for it. For instance, they do not expect to have great
daylight when it is very cloudy.

If it is not possible to offer comfort everywhere, priorities can be set based on how 
frequently the different spaces of the home are used.
