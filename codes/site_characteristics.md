# site characteristics

Not all sites in the same neighbourhood are the same. For instance, some 
may obstructed from sun and wind by trees, retaining walls, or hills. Others can be totally exposed.

Sites close to greenery and water seem to be especially good for Air quality and Coolness.

This code is similar to the [neighbourhood characteristics](code=neighbourhood_characteristics)
but at a smaller scale (i.e. site scale as opposed to urban scale).
