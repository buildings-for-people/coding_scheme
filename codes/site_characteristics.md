# site characteristics

Not all sites in the same neighbourhood are the same. Obstructions—such as retaining walls, trees, 
or hills—can make a site less sunny while protecting it from the wind. Similarly, green
areas are seen as beneficial for air quality and for preventing overheating. These cues can 
be read by people to infer what the future might be like.

This code is similar to the [neighbourhood characteristics](code=neighbourhood_characteristics)
but at a smaller scale (i.e. site scale as opposed to urban scale).
