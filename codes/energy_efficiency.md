### energy efficiency

Heating, cooling, lighting and ventilating 
all consume energy. Some people expressed their concern with regards
to the environmental impact of their actions. Namely, people will need
to choose whether they want to be comfortable while producing some 
negative environmental impacts; or feeling relatively uncomfortable
while lowering the environmental impacts of their actions.

While strongly related to [utility bills](code=utility_bills), the 
motivation of favouring energy efficiency does not necessarily rely 
on financial estimations.
