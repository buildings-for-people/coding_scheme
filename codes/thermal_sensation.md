# thermal sensation

Thermal sensation is the name that has been historically
given to the perception of how cold or hot is the space.
It is usually measured using bipolar adjective (i.e. a 
Likert) scale that goes from "Too Cold" to "Too Hot" 
going through "Neutral".

It is very often assumed that "neutral" or "nearly-neutral"
thermal sensations imply comfort. So, people's quotes gathered
within this code include those referring to pure sensation (e.g.
"cold", "hot") and also to thermal preference (e.g. "pleasant 
temperature").

Since Thermal Sensation is a perception that considers 
the overall thermal environment, it might be necessary 
to consider that different parts of people's body might 
feel colder or hotter. This is reflected, for instance, 
in that the [floor temperature](code=floor_contact_temperature)
seems to be quite relevant for people.
