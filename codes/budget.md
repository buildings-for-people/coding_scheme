### budget

While people do want to be comfortable, they will not necessarily
spend all the money necessary to make their homes comfortable. The 
reason for this might be that financial stability is also one 
important aspect of people's lives. Comfort cannot be analyzed in 
isolation. 

While a person's socioeconomic condition will affect this internal element, 
is not necessarily true that people who can afford to do it will pay 
whatever it takes. Some people seem to have a budget allocated for this 
item, and intend to stick to it. When that budget is not enough, they 
might [choose](layer=trade-offs) to sacrifice comfort in favour of 
lower [utility bills](code=utility_bills). This is a clear example
of [trade-offs](layer=trade-offs)
