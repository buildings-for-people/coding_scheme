# budget

While people do want to be comfortable, they will not necessarily
spend all the money necessary to make their homes comfortable. On the contrary, some of them seem to have a pre-allocated budget for utility bills. When that budget is not enough, they might chose to sacrifice comfort in favour of keeping the utility bills low.

While a person's socioeconomic condition will affect their budget, it 
is not necessarily true that people who can afford to do it will pay 
whatever it takes.
