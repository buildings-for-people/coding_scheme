# views

The [availability of windows and skylights](code=availability_of_windows_and_skylights)
not only provides daylight but also views. This was identified 
by some respondents, who argued that dwellings with good daylight also 
have views. 

There is a self-evident correlation between views and daylight. 
However, it is unclear whether different views to outside (more open, 
obstructed, rural or urban) will affect the perception of 
brightness of the space, or the satisfaction with it in terms
of visual comfort.
