# daylight vs thermal comfort

Increasing windows to maximize daylight has the consequence
of reducing thermal insulation and thus increasing the chances
of feeling cold.

Also, maximizing daylight and warmth can lead to
an excessively hot home in summer, if not done carefully. The choice, 
then, is to have plenty of daylight while suffering from
hight temperatures, or being thermally comfortable in a
relatively dark home.
