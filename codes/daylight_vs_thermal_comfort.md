# daylight vs thermal comfort

Increasing windows to maximize daylight has the consequence
of reducing thermal insulation and thus increasing the chances
of feeling cold.

Also, maximizing daylight and warmth can lead to
an excessively hot home in summer, if not done carefully. People need 
to choose, then, between having plenty of daylight while suffering 
from high temperatures and being thermally comfortable in a
relatively dark home.
