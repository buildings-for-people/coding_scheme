# acoustic privacy

Privacy is the perception of being invaded by other people. Specifically for this model, it relates to 
other people hearing our actions.

This is different from the perception of 
[bothering others](code=bothering_others), 
because privacy is not about *others* being 
affected, but ourselves.

The [loss of privacy](code=loss_of_visual_privacy) associated with Daylight and Coolness is the 
same concept. However, but mostly applied to observation (e.g. through openings and windows).
