# location

Location is one of the first factors that people
consider when searching for a new home. Commuting is, generally,
not fun at all. However, while making this choice,
people need to decide between enjoying the benefits of a centrally 
located home or the quietness and peace of the more remote suburbs.

Of course, the [streets nearby](code=streets_nearby) will also
influence this trade-off. For instance, there might be some centrally 
located homes that have a good acoustic performance due to the specific street they are located in. But this is 
not necessarily the case for all homes.
