# exposure to solar radiation

Even when the air in a room is maintained at a subjectively pleasant  temperature, being exposed
to solar radiation can significantly affect people's thermal 
perception and thermal comfort. If it is cold, the sun might be 
welcomed; but if it is hot, it is definitely not.

Also, rooms that are exposed to solar radiation are associated to a lack of humidity and dampness.
