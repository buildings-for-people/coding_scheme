# loudness vs origin

[Loudness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness) 
is a measure of how strong a sound is, and depends mostly
on pressure level (i.e. decibels) and frequency. However, it is important to acknowledge that 
noises (i.e., unwanted sounds) of equal loudness may be more or less unpleasant at different times of the day or in different situations and depending on their source.

People distinguish clearly between different sources
of noise.

* Noise from neighbours

* Noise from common spaces (e.g. pools, parks, lobbies)

* City noise (e.g. traffic, horns, etc.)

* Toilet and pipes noise 

* Noises that come from the house itself (e.g. squeaky doors, cracking floors)

* Noises produced by those who live in the house (e.g. kitchen appliances, children, pets)

These different sources will trigger different cognitive 
responses. For instance, noises from neighbours, common spaces,
and those from the city cannot be controlled and are not part of the natural consequence of their actions, thus being highly
 unpleasant. On the contrary, the noise produced by those who 
live in the house is relatively easier to control and therefore 
less unpleasant. This is highly related to the 
[expected outcomes](layer=expected_outcomes). 

Toilet and pipes noises, on their part, are likely to contribute 
to a perception of reduced [acoustic privacy](code=acoustic_privacy). Finally, noises that come from the house itself are interpreted as an 
indicator of wear and tear, and therefore are unpleasant.
