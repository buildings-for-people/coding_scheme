# materials that feel warm

Some materials seem to feel warmer than others to the eyes
of people. This might be related to the 
[thermal effusicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_effusivity),
mentioned also when discussing the 
[floor contact temperature](code=floor_contact_temperature),
but also to more aesthetic reasons. Further research is 
required.
