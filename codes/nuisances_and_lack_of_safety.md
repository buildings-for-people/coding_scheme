### nuisances and lack of safety

Just as in the case of [utility bills](code=utility_bills), safety
can be a priority for people. Thus, all appliances and systems in their 
homes should be safe to operate so people are not forced to choose 
between their safety and their comfort. Also, operating these
systems should not be unpleasant enough for them to be left unused.
