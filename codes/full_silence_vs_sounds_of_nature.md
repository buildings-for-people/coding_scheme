# full silence vs sounds of nature

As explained in [the sound of silence](code=the_sound_of_silence), 
people do not necessarily seek for absolute silence but for the soothing sound of nature. However, sometimes they often need to 
choose between blocking both the pleasant natural sounds as well as human noises, or letting both in. Generally, it would seem that people prefer to block it all.
