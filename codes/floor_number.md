# floor number

Upper storeys or floors seem to be associated with more heat. Sometimes the explanation is 
that heat goes up (e.g., the upper floors in a house are hotter than the lower ones), and also that apartments that are higher take 
advantage of the heat of apartments below. 

Some other explanations were identified (e.g., there are no windows or cooling) but, generally, it seems that upper storeys are warmer/hotter than others.
