# sensation when entering a space

First impressions count. Even if they are brief, it is possible 
that the short experience of entering a comfortable space leaves 
some mark in people's overall assessment of such a space's comfort.

This might, or might not (depending on the domain), be related to 
the physiological phenomenon known as 
[Alliesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliesthesia). This
is the pleasure felt when a certain external stimuli restores
some internal variable that was misplaced. For instance, people often  
feel this when entering a warm space after walking in 
the cold for a relatively ling time, and when being exposed to a cool breeze when feeling 
too hot.
