### sensation when entering a space

First impressions count. Even if they are brief, it is possible 
that the short experience of entering a comfortable space leaves 
some mark in people's overall assessment of such a space's comfort.

This may, or may not (depending on the domain) be related to 
the physiological phenomenon known as 
[Alliesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliesthesia). This
is the pleasure felt when a certain external stimuli restores
some internal variable that misplaced. For instance, people often  
feel this when getting into a warm space after being walking in 
the cold, or when being exposed to a cool breeze when feeling 
too hot.
