# feeling of confinement

Some people reported that naturally illuminated spaces
feel less enclosed. It is possible that this perception is related to the perception of
[Sense of Connection with the Exterior](code=sense_of_connection_with_the_exterior),
although further research is needed to verify this. Similarly, 
it is hard to know whether this effect would still exist
if daylight was provided without views.

The Feeling of Confinement is also perceived in spaces that are excessively hot or in which the air feels heavy and stuffy. As mentioned in the code of [Air Temperature](code=air_temperature), these two variables—the perceived quality of the air and the air temperature—seem to be related.
