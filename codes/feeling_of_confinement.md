# feeling of confinement

Some people reported that naturally illuminated spaces
feel less enclosed. It is possible that this perception is related to the 
[sense of connection with the exterior](code=sense_of_connection_with_the_exterior),
but stating this would require further research. Likewise, 
it is hard to know whether this effect would still exist
if daylight was provided without views.

The feeling of confinement is also associated with excessively
hot spaces.
