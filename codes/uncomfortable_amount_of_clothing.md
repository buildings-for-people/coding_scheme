# uncomfortable amount of clothing

While people can feel warmer by wearing more layers of clothing, 
they do not always do it happily. Sometimes people feel that they
need to wear more layers than what they find appropriate. The same happens 
during hot days, when people can potentially take off more layers but they 
hesitate. The options are, then, to wear comfortable clothing while feeling relatively uncomfortable, or to wear more appropriate clothing while feeling more comfortable.
