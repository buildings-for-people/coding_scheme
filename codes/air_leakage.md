### air leakage

Air leaks into homes (through windows, doors, and other)
can affect people's experience in them. For instance, when 
a home is kept at a pleasant temperature, air that leaks 
while in being too hot or too cold will change the whole 
temperature of the space. Also, directly receiving leaking
air at an unpleasant temperature can become some sort of 
thermal shock; namely, a dramatic change in thermal sensation.
