# air leakage

Air that leaks into homes (through windows, doors, and other elements)
can affect people's experience in them. For instance, when 
a home is kept at a pleasant temperature, hot or cold air that leaks 
into the dwelling can dramatically change its temperature. Moreover, 
being directly exposed to leaking air can produce unpleasant and dramatic changes in thermal sensation.
