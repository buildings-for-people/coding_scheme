# Bothering others

The feeling of comfort is a state of the mind, and thus it is not 
limited to physiological sensations or even to a person's own 
body. One example of this is how people worry about bothering 
others. 

For instance, people often worry about making noise that 
can be unpleasant for other people in the house and also of 
neighbours. Something similar might happen when cooking, in which
the odours of one individual's kitchen can affect neighbours.
