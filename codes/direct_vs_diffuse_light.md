# direct vs diffuse light

Daylight can be separated into two components: diffuse and direct. 

Examples of Diffuse Daylight are the light coming from the 
sky on a cloudy day and the light reflected by buildings 
or snow. This component of natural light creates gentle shadows
and will often be less powerful than its direct component.

The most obvious example of Direct Daylight, on its part, is 
the light that the sun casts on a clear sunny day. It is a 
powerful stream of light that creates strong and well-defined
shadows.

Depending on the situation, people might prefer one over the other.
Direct daylight carries with it a lot of heat, and thus it might
be unpleasant for people who live in hot and sunny locations.
