# neighbourhood demographics

Not everyone likes to do the same things at the same time. These differences
can be, at least in part, explained by the demographics of different groups.
For instance, young people tend to stay until late while older people or families tend to
get up early. This affects the experience of people in certain neighbourhoods.

This code, together with [neighbourhood characteristics](code=neighbourhood_characteristics)
describe the location at a neighbourhood scale. Specifically, while demographics describes 
the human factors, the [characteristics](code=neighbourhood_characteristics) describe 
the more physical factors (e.g. neighbouring infrastructure, restaurants, etc.)
