# thermal comfort vs air quality

Ventilating implies bringing fresh air into the home. Doing this during
cold days can be a nuisance, as that air will be cold and might lower the
temperature of the whole house. Something similar happens during hot days.
The choices are to ventilate and feel thermally uncomfortable, or not to 
ventilate and feel relatively fine. (This is, of course, assuming that it 
is possible to maintain the dwelling at a more pleasant temperature than
the exterior)
