# openness of the space

Having more [doors between spaces](code=doors_between_spaces) reduces the 
transmission of noise and odours across the space. However, some people would rather not 
have these doors due to their lifestyle. Thus there is a trade-off between their [freedom](code=freedom_to_do_what_you_want_wherever_you_want) and acoustic performance.
