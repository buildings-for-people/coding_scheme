# complete silence vs sounds of nature

People do not necessarily want absolute silence but for the soothing sound of nature (see [The Sound of Silence](code=the_sound_of_silence)). However, sometimes they need to 
choose between blocking both the pleasant natural sounds as well as human noises, or letting both in. It would seem that people generally prefer to block it all.
