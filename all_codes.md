# acoustic absorption
A lack of Acoustic Absorption can be an unpleasant experience in dwellings. It affects the clarity of the audio and conversations.
# acoustic insulation
Not all walls, windows or doors are equally effective at stopping the noise. People know this and therefore it becomes a relevant input to their assessment of a space.
The insulation is not only intended to stop outside noises, but also noise transferred between spaces.
# acoustic privacy
Privacy is the perception of being invaded by other people. Specifically for this model, it relates to other people hearing our actions.
This is different from the perception of [bothering others](code=bothering_others), because privacy is not about *others* being affected, but ourselves.
The [loss of privacy](code=loss_of_visual_privacy) associated with Daylight and Coolness is the same concept. However, but mostly applied to observation (e.g. through openings and windows).
# aesthetics
Some systems, materials, appliances or design choices are beneficial for the performance of the house, but are just not aesthetically pleasant. The choice, in this case, is to have a comfortable but less beautiful home, or to have a more beautiful and less comfortable one.
# affective attributes
The word warmness, especially in Spanish, seems to be strongly associated with how welcoming and liveable a space is. Thus, within their descriptions of a warm dwelling, people often mentioned elements that were, apparently, not related to thermal comfort but to their aspirations and [lifestyle](code=lifestyle). These quotes have been gathered under Affective Attributes.
# air leakage
Air leaks into homes (through windows, doors, and other) can affect people's experience in them. For instance, when a home is kept at a pleasant temperature, air that leaks while in being too hot or too cold will change the whole temperature of the space. Also, directly receiving leaking air at an unpleasant temperature can become some sort of thermal shock; namely, a dramatic change in thermal sensation.
# air quality vs acoustic performance
Opening windows allows cleaning the air in the home, but sometimes outside is noisy. While [ventilation systems](code=ventilation_system) can potentially solve this problem, they can be noisy or can transmit noise, which can make them unpleasant.
# air temperature
The temperature of the air within a space is an important determinant of thermal comfort. This has been evidenced by the thermal comfort literature numerous times.
It is possible that when people talk about "air temperature" they are actually talking about Operative Temperature or Mean Radiant Temperature without knowing it.
# attractiveness of the space
One of the functions of daylight, according to the respondents, is to make spaces more attractive. They look better, and more welcoming.
# availability of windows and skylights
Windows and skylights are probably the most common and intuitive way of letting daylight in. However, not all windows and all skylights will be equally effective. On the contrary, if a room has windows or skylights that are obstructed, or too small, or there are very few of them, people might not get the impression of it being properly illuminated. 
As to what do people mean by "decent size" and "lots of windows", we don't know. It is possible that this will depend on the [views](code=views), the [site](code=site_characteristics), and perhaps some other factors.
# awareness of air pollution
Air pollution is not always visible and people are not always capable of perceiving it inside their homes. Nonetheless, either because of the news or by looking at it from afar, people are often aware that pollution is there.
# bed temperature
Sleeping is one of the things people do at home. They want to sleep in a bed with an appropriate temperature. If it is cold, it seems to be something they do remember.
The temperature of the bed is, obviously, related to the temperature of the bedroom. However, when talking about warmness, people specifically mentioned the bed; whereas, when talking about coolness, they talked about the temperature of the whole room. This might be explained by the fact that, when it is too hot, people do not get *in* the bed, necessarily.
# Bothering others
The feeling of comfort is a state of the mind, and thus it is not limited to physiological sensations or even to individual's own body. One example of this is how people worry about bothering others. 
For instance, people often worry about making noise that can be unpleasant for other people in the house and also of neighbours. Something similar might happen when cooking, in which the odours of one individual's kitchen can affect neighbours.
# breezes
Letting air in allows both reducing the [thermal sensation](code=thermal_sensation) and cleaning the air. 
An actual breeze—as opposed to just heat-driven convective currents—seem to be the feedback that people need to *perceive* that fresh air is coming in.
# budget
While people do want to be comfortable, they will not necessarily spend all the money necessary to make their homes comfortable. The reason for this might be that financial stability is also one important aspect of people's lives. Comfort cannot be analyzed in isolation. 
While a person's socioeconomic condition will affect this internal element, is not necessarily true that people who can afford to do it will pay whatever it takes. Some people seem to have a budget allocated for this item, and intend to stick to it. When that budget is not enough, they might [choose](layer=trade-offs) to sacrifice comfort in favour of lower [utility bills](code=utility_bills). This is a clear example of [trade-offs](layer=trade-offs)
# bugs
Opening windows is very useful for cooling down dwellings. However, if there are bugs outside, this becomes an issue.
Simple solutions, such as fly-screens, might be enough to solve this issue.
# cleanability of the space
All homes will contain some dust and dirt. Nonetheless, not all of them are equally easy to clean. So, materials that are easier to clean tend to be associated with a better air quality.
See also [dust](code=dust_and_smoke) as an environmental cue.
# cleanliness of the space
Respondents often linked the amount of daylight in a space, as well as its temperature, to the perception of cleanliness of it. Hot places are perceived as unhygienic, while spaces with plenty of natural light are perceived clean.
# colour of the space
Daylight will penetrate more or less into the space depending on the colour (or, more specifically, the reflectivity of the materials) in the space. Lighter colours would allow daylight to get further into rooms, which was raised by some respondents.
# complete silence vs sounds of nature
As explained in [the sound of silence](code=the_sound_of_silence), people do not necessarily seek for absolute silence but for the soothing sound of nature. However, sometimes they often need to choose between blocking both the pleasant natural sounds as well as human noises, or letting both in. Generally, it would seem that people prefer to block it all.
# condensation and mould
Condensation and mould are indicators of cold and humidity, thus related to a lack of air quality and warmness.
# coolness vs warmness
This model treats coolness and warmness separately, but they are tightly related. People know that favouring one over the other might not be beneficial in the end. Balance is needed.
# damage to objects in the house
Getting natural light is great, but it can damage objects in the house.
# daylight sufficiency
A space will be perceived as "sufficiently illuminated" when it has just enough natural light to somehow warm it up and allow operating without the need for electric lighting. However, this quantity does not seem to be nearly enough. People mentioned the need for *quality* of light instead of *quantity* of it and also that they want much more light than what is required to read a book.
People expressed how they connect the availability of daylight with the perception of a space being warm.
# daylight vs thermal comfort
Increasing windows to maximize daylight has the consequence of reducing thermal insulation and thus increasing the chances of feeling cold.
Also, maximizing daylight and warmth can lead to an excessively hot home in summer, if not done carefully. The choice, then, is to have plenty of daylight while suffering from hight temperatures, or being thermally comfortable in a relatively dark home.
# direct vs diffuse light
Daylight can be separated into two components: diffuse and direct. 
Examples of Diffuse Daylight are the light coming from the sky on a cloudy day and the light reflected by buildings or snow. This component of natural light creates gentle shadows and will often be less powerful than its direct component.
The most obvious example of Direct Daylight, on its part, is the light that the sun casts on a clear sunny day. It is a powerful stream of light that creates strong and well-defined shadows.
Depending on the situation, people might prefer one over the other. Direct daylight carries with it a lot of heat, and thus it might be unpleasant for people who live in hot and sunny locations.
# direction of the light
While it is not entirely clear why, the slope of the natural light entering the space might matter. Specifically, respondents from Santiago (Chile) argued that the more vertical the angle of natural light, the better. The arguments were of two kinds, when given. The first one is that vertical sun is easier to control (i.e. it does not strike over the whole room, just the perimeter), which is convenient for hot locations with strong solar radiation. The second reason was related to the fact that light coming from above emulates an exterior light setting better than lateral light.
# doors between spaces
Preventing noise and transmission of odours is not always easy. However, sometimes having some doors is enough. This [effective mechanism](code=effective_and_simple_systems) seems to be a good indicator of [how noisy the dwelling might become in the future](layer=expected_outcomes).
# dust and smoke
While not always included in the list of relevant factors related to air quality, dust can be quite annoying for people. Different [sites](code=site_characteristics) and [neighbourhoods] (code=neighbourhood_characteristics) will be more or less exposed to dust.
Smoke is more often considered, and should be considered as well.
This is also related to the [cleanability of the space](code=cleanability_of_the_space).
# dwelling typology
Depending on whether people are looking for, or live in, an apartment, detached or attached house, or other kind of dwelling, their experiences and concerns will vary.
# effective and simple systems
The systems installed in the home in order to make it comfortable should act quickly and be simple to use. A dwelling is allowed to be cold, for instance, but that situation that situation should be easy and to fix.
Sometimes, most systems are ineffective, making people feel helpless.
# energy efficiency
Heating, cooling, lighting and ventilating all consume energy. Some people expressed their concern with regards to the environmental impact of their actions. Namely, people will need to choose whether they want to be comfortable while producing some negative environmental impacts; or feeling relatively uncomfortable while lowering the environmental impacts of their actions.
While strongly related to [utility bills](code=utility_bills), the motivation of favouring energy efficiency does not necessarily rely on financial estimations.
# exposure to solar radiation
Even if the air might be at a certain temperature, being exposed to solar radiation can significantly affect people's thermal perception and thermal comfort. If it is cold, the sun might be welcomed; but if it is hot, it is definitely not.
# exposure to wind
In some places, wind can be strong enough to become an impediment to open windows.
# feeling of confinement
Some people reported that naturally illuminated spaces feel less enclosed. It is possible that this perception is related to the [sense of connection with the exterior](code=sense_of_connection_with_the_exterior), but stating this would require further research. Likewise, it is hard to know whether this effect would still exist if daylight was provided without views.
The feeling of confinement is also associated with excessively hot spaces.
# floor contact temperature
The floor contact temperature seems to be an important determinant of the perception of thermal comfort in dwellings. This is affected by both the temperature of the floor top surface (as measured through a thermometer) and the thermal properties of the materials in the floor. Specifically, the material's [Thermal Effusivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_effusivity).
# floor number
Upper storeys or floors seem to be associated to more heat. Sometimes the explanation is that heat goes up (e.e. the upper floors in a house are hotter than the lower ones), and also that apartments that are higher take advantage of the heat of apartments below. 
Sometimes there are other explanations (e.g. there are no windows or cooling), but in general, it seems that upper storeys are warmer/hotter than others.
# freedom to do what you want wherever you want
A comfortable home should allow people carry out with their lives without being an impediment. People seem to want a home that will not significantly affect their lifestyles.
# glare
Glare is the difficulty for seeing, strongly associated to excessive contrast or brightness. While quite important in office settings, it seems to be relatively irrelevant in residential settings.
# heating and cooling system
In areas that are too cold or hot, having a mechanical system that does not rely on the weather might be the only option for being sure that the space can be maintained at pleasant temperature.
# household composition
The feeling of comfort is a state of the mind, and thus it is not limited to physiological sensations or even to individuals' own body. The health and wellbeing of others, such as children and family, can deeply affect a person's satisfaction with a home, thus affecting their [mental wellbeing](code=mental_wellbeing).
# increased maintenance and reduced durability
Some technologies and construction materials are beneficial for comfort. However, they sometimes carry some extra costs or they do not last as much as other alternatives.
# lifestyle
An important component of the [feeling of comfort](layer=comfort) is the [freedom to do what you want wherever you want](code=freedom_to_do_what_you_want_wherever_you_want). In other words, people want homes that do not determine or negatively affect their lifestyle. 
Sometimes, especially in Spanish, the word Warmness was interpreted as Coziness. Thus, quotes in that domain often go beyond thermal aspects, reaching the realm of lifestyle.
# light pollution
Opening curtains and windows at night can become an issue when there is too much light outside.
# location
Location is one of the first factors that people consider when searching for a new home. Commuting is, generally, not fun at all. However, while making this choice, people need to decide between enjoying the benefits of a centrally located home or the quietness and peace of the more remote suburbs.
Of course, the [streets nearby](code=streets_nearby) will also influence this trade-off. Namely, there might be some centrally located homes that have a good acoustic performance. But this is not necessarily the case for all homes.
# loss of views
Views are not always in the direction that maximizes daylight. Thus, people sometimes need to choose one or the other, unless the dwelling is somehow designed for getting both.
This code should be applicable also for other domains (e.g. warmness, coolness, and noise); but it has been mentioned only for daylight.
# loss of privacy
Increasing the transparency in the facade increases the amount of natural light, but it also reduces privacy.
# loudness vs origin
[Loudness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness) is a measure of how strong a sound is, and depends mostly on pressure level (i.e. decibels) and frequency. Within the framework we introduce, it is important to acknowledges that equal loudness may be more or less unpleasant at different times of the day or at different situations.
People distinguish clearly between different sources of noise.
* Noise from neighbours
* Noise from common spaces (e.g. pools, parks, lobbies)
* City noise (e.g. traffic, horns, etc.)
* Toilet and pipes noise 
* Noises that come from the house itself (e.g. squeaky doors, cracking floors)
* Noise produced by those who live in the house (e.g. kitchen appliances, children, pets)
These different sources will trigger different cognitive responses. For instance, noises from neighbours, common spaces, and those from the city cannot be controlled and therefore are unpleasant. On the contrary, noise produced by those who live in the house is relatively easier to control and therefore less unpleasant. This is highly related to the [expected outcomes](layer=expected_outcomes). 
Toilet and pipes noises, on their part, are likely to contribute to a perception of reduced [acoustic privacy](code=acoustic_privacy). Finally, noises that come from the house itself are interpreted as an indicator of wear and tear, and therefore are unpleasant.
# love for music
People who like listening to or playing music may be particularly sensitive to acoustic conditions. On the one hand, they may worry about [bothering others](code=bothering_others), but they might also simply want to [be able to freely listen to music](code=freedom_to_do_what_you_want_wherever_you_want).
# materials perceived as humid
There seem to be some construction materials that, according to people, absorb water and thus tend to be more or less beneficial to air quality. Nonetheless, only a few people mentioned this and they do not agree with each other.
# materials that feel warm
Some materials seem to feel warmer than others to the eyes of people. This might be related to the [thermal effusicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_effusivity), mentioned also when discussing the [floor contact temperature](code=floor_contact_temperature), but also to more aesthetic reasons. Further research is required.
# mean radiant temperature
Sometimes it is not the air that is hot, or the sun that is striking, but heat irradiated from certain hot surfaces. It feels different.
# mental wellbeing
A comfortable home makes people happy and fills them with energy. It allows them to be sure that their families will be healthy.
# neighbourhood characteristics
The infrastructure and the nature of the constructions in different neighbourhoods affect the way these are perceived by people. Some neighbourhoods, for example, have a great amount of restaurants, others are close to landfields, others only have offices and thus are nearly empty at night. 
In a similar manner, institutional differences can also affect the way in which neighbourhoods perform. For instance, some neighrbourhoods allow people to use log burners and/or pubs to stay open till late while others do not. This affects the way the neighbourhood is perceived by the people who live in it.
 This code, together with [neighbourhood demographics](code=neighbourhood_demographics) describe the location at a neighbourhood scale. Specifically, while [demographics](code=neighbourhood_demographics) describes the human factors (e.g. people are quiet, old, young, etc.), this code describes the more physical factors. Also, the [site characteristics](code=site_characteristics) describe the location at a smaller scale.
# neighbourhood demographics
Not everyone likes to do the same things at the same time. These differences can be, at least in part, explained by the demographics of different groups. For instance, young people tend to stay until late while older people or families tend to get up early. This affects the experience of people in certain neighbourhoods.
This code, together with [neighbourhood characteristics](code=neighbourhood_characteristics) describe the location at a neighbourhood scale. Specifically, while demographics describes the human factors, the [characteristics](code=neighbourhood_characteristics) describe the more physical factors (e.g. neighbouring infrastructure, restaurants, etc.)
# nuisances and lack of safety
Just as in the case of [utility bills](code=utility_bills), safety can be a priority for people. Thus, all appliances and systems in their homes should be safe to operate so people are not forced to choose between their safety and their comfort. Also, operating these systems should not be unpleasant enough for them to be left unused.
# odours
The sense of smell is used to assess air quality. Bad smells are associated with poor air quality.
# openness of the space
Having more [doors between spaces](code=doors_between_spaces) reduces the transmission of noise and odours across the space. However, some people would rather not have these doors due to their lifestyle. Thus there is a trade-off between their [freedom](code=freedom_to_do_what_you_want_wherever_you_want) and acoustic performance.
# orientation
The sun does not strike equally in all directions. In the northern hemisphere, the sun will generally strike from the South; while in the southern hemisphere, from the North. These differences imply that some orientations will receive more sunlight and, therefore, be hotter, brighter and more or less pleasant.
# passive design
Having heating, lighting, cooling, and ventilation systems that are simple to use, effective, cheap to run, and reliable is a good thing. But having a home that does not often rely on these systems is even better.
# pets
Pets—specifically the [neighbours'](code=proximity_to_neighbours) pets—can be the source of noise, allergies, and other nuisances.
# physical wellbeing
Comfortable homes tend to also be healthy, which is something that people value.
# protection from moisture
Humid locations can feel cold on the outside and thus people worry homes in those locations being cold. Barriers and mechanisms can help.
# proximity to neighbours
Neighbours are can be the source of certain nuisances. Specifically, noise, privacy, and odours were mentioned. This might be related to their [pets](code=pets) or to the neighbours themselves.
So, if neighbours are too close, people will infer that they will be exposed to some uncomfortable situations in the future.
# relative humidity
A high (perceived) relative humidity seems to be associated with poor air quality and a higher [thermal sensation](code=thermal_sensation).
# Safety
People often like to open the windows, although that may come with issues of safety. Leaving the windows open is not always a good idea.
Likewise, while it is common to like quiet homes, that can imply a lack of connection to family and neighbours which help feeling safe.
# sensation when entering a space
First impressions count. Even if they are brief, it is possible that the short experience of entering a comfortable space leaves some mark in people's overall assessment of such a space's comfort.
This may, or may not (depending on the domain) be related to the physiological phenomenon known as [Alliesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliesthesia). This is the pleasure felt when a certain external stimuli restores some internal variable that misplaced. For instance, people often  feel this when getting into a warm space after being walking in the cold, or when being exposed to a cool breeze when feeling too hot.
# sense of community
Even if [neighbours might be the source of some nuisances](code=proximity_to_neighbours), people seem keen to be part of a community.
# sense of connection with the exterior
Having daylight allows people to connect with the exterior. It helps them feel how the time passes and whether it is daytime or nighttime. 
It is possible that this perception is related to the reduced [feeling of confinement](code=feeling_of_confinement), but stating this would require further research.
# sensitivity to noise
Some people are simply more sensitive to noise than others. Whether this is because of some illness, the nature of their job, or simply because of personal preferences, understanding the specific requirements can be significantly relevant.
# sensitivity to odours and dust
Some people are more sensitive to odours and dust than others. Reasons for this include a good/bad sense of smell, allergies, or simply not caring more or less about it.
# site characteristics
Not all sites in the same neighbourhood are the same. For instance, some may obstructed from sun and wind by trees, retaining walls, or hills. Others can be totally exposed.
Sites close to greenery and water seem to be especially good for Air quality and Coolness.
This code is similar to the [neighbourhood characteristics](code=neighbourhood_characteristics) but at a smaller scale (i.e. site scale as opposed to urban scale).
# size of the space
The size of the space affects our perception of it and also its thermodynamic and optical behavour. Bigger spaces tend to be harder to warm up and cool down, for instance. This characteristic is one of the first elements that people notice, sometimes associating it to their assessment of comfort.
# streets nearby
Streets have cars, buses and trucks. These are noisy, dirty and smelly. 
Not all streets are the same, though. People tend to know which streets are busier and which streets are quiet.
# systems that do not fail
Hopefully, homes should be robust enough to consistently offer comfortable spaces for people. This implies, for instance, that heaters should fail as little a possible; and if they fail, this event should not prevent the whole house from being livable. Likewise, windows should consistently keep the cold and rain outside.
# temporary
Some nuisances and uncomfortable situations will always exist. This becomes an issue when we have no [means to solve them](code=effective_and_simple_systems). In this case, the best we can do is expect it finishes soon. Sometimes we know that.
# the sound of silence
While people often say that absolute silence is what they want, several people also reported that they like hearing natural sounds.
So, the sound of silence is not absolutely quiet, but just natural and soothing.
# Thermal comfort vs acoustic performance
People commonly open the windows when it is hot. However, sometimes this results in an even more unpleasant situation due to exterior noise.
# thermal comfort vs air quality
Ventilating implies bringing fresh air into the home. Doing this during cold days can be a nuisance, as that air will be cold and might lower the temperature of the whole house. The choices are to ventilate and feel cold, or not to ventilate and feel warm.
# thermal insulation
Whether they have been taught about this or they intuitively know it, thermal insulation is one of the characteristics that people will use when making predictions about thermal comfort.
# thermal mass
While probably related to (and even, perhaps, confused with) [thermal insulation](code=thermal_insulation), thick and heavy walls are noticed by people. These appear to be associated with cool homes.
# thermal preference
While people tend to agree about the range of temperatures that are considered acceptable (i.e. somewhere around 18C to 26C), choosing an exact temperature within this range is complicated. Thermal preferences vary.
# thermal sensation
Thermal sensation is the name that has been historically given to the perception of how cold or hot is the space. It is usually measured using bipolar adjective (i.e. a Likert) scale that goes from "Too Cold" to "Too Hot" going through "Neutral".
It is very often assumed that "neutral" or "nearly-neutral" thermal sensations imply comfort. So, people's quotes gathered within this code include those referring to pure sensation (e.g. "cold", "hot") and also to thermal preference (e.g. "pleasant temperature").
Since Thermal Sensation is a perception that considers the overall thermal environment, it might be necessary to consider that different parts of people's body might feel colder or hotter. This is reflected, for instance, in that the [floor temperature](code=floor_contact_temperature) seems to be quite relevant for people.
# times of occupancy
The experience of people in a certain dwelling might be dramatically different depending on their routines and schedules. A retired person, for instance, might want to have daylight all day. Whereas a busy person who gets home late and only sleeps there might favour mornings or evenings.
# uncomfortable amount of clothing
While people can feel warmer by wearing more layers of clothing, they do not always do it happily. Sometimes people feel that they need to wear more layers than what they find appropriate. The choice, then, is to wear comfortable clothing while feeling relatively uncomfortable, or to wear more appropriate clothing while feeling more comfortable.
# utility bills
While people do not want comfortable homes in order to save money in utility bills, bills that are too high can definitely affect the experience of people in their homes in a negative way. Some people will spend whatever amount of money is required to be comfortable, but others will simply sacrifice their level of comfort and avoid spending more than what they have budgeted to this field. This is related to people's [budget](code=budget).
# ventilation system
[Windows](code=availability_of_windows_and_skylights) are good for air quality. But they are not always available or sometimes they are not effective enough. A mechanical ventilation system—e.g. an exhaust fan—can help.
It is worth noticing that some people do not trust these system too much and favour opening windows.
# views
The [availability of windows and skylights](code=availability_of_windows_and_skylights) not only provides daylight, but also views. This was identified by some respondents, who argued that dwellings with good daylight also have views. 
There is a self-evident correlation between views and daylight. However, it is unclear whether different views to outside (more open, obstructed, rural or urban) will affect the perception of brightness of the space, or the satisfaction with it in terms of visual comfort.
# weather sounds
The amount of noise or sound from the exterior—e.g. rain, hail, wind—seems to influence the perception of comfort. This appears to be related to [expected outcomes](layer=expected_outcomes); specifically, to [the fear of the envelope failing](code=systems_that_do_not_fail).
